I'll start this off quickly with that i enjoyed the lessons and am surprisingly happy with how the 
website turned out.

I added a requirments.md file as a sort of checklist for myself of all the things we had to do, 
including why i think i achieved them.

I did not add a mobile.png to the design folder as we didn't have to make a mobile design for
web design and as such i didn't have it.

There are slight differences between the webdesign and webmarkup site. Things like the
footer missing and images not being exactly aligned.
The footer is missing in webdesign because there was no more room at the bottom and webdesign pages had a size limit so i couldn't have it scroll or something. I did add it in the webmarkup site.

Images being in a different place on the detail pages are because i couldn't get them to be in the correct place and play nice with the text so i decided to just have them underneath each other. This is actually what my original design for the webdesign site was.
